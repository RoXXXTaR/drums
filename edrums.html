<h2><p>Better pads and smaller processors have ushered in an eDrum renaissance in recent years, with today’s kits being sleeker, more powerful, and more affordable than ever before in history. Whether you’re in the market for your first eKit or searching for the most transformative drumming experience money can buy, now is a great time to pull the trigger. Here are seven of Sweetwater’s favorite electronic drum kits available in 2022.</p>
<p>The Rankings</p></h2>
<h5>
<div id="smalltext">
	<li>Value — How much “kit” do you get for the price?</li>
	<li>Sound — How many sounds come stock, and of what quality? Is it possible to get that kit-in-a-room response through headphones or speakers?</li>
	<li>Response — How responsive are the pads and module? Is there perceptible lag? How do the pads perform? Do they rebound similar to acoustic drumheads?</li>
	<li>Durability — How well does the kit hold up?</li>
	<li>Extras — Does the kit have any standout features? A large display? Onboard practice and training tools? USB MIDI control? Importable user sounds?</li>
	<li>Replay — How likely is a player to hang on to the kit and continue playing it down the road?</li></h5>
