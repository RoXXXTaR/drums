	<h2>
	<p>Hello, music lovers! I am Timor Doev, 33 y.o mid-skilled drummer and let's try to figure out which kind of drum kit you should buy as your first one. Actually, I started with acoustic set, but later I've been played both for more than 7 years.</p>

	<h2><p>	Asking the right questions.</p>	</h2>
	<p>The points above are good to know, but there are other essential questions. What are the pros and cons of electronic drums? Which brands are the best for beginner drummers? Are electric drums really noise-free? What is included with the drum set, and what is extra? Fear not! We are here to help you choose the best option for your own personal situation.</p>
	<h2><p>What are electronic drums?</p></h2>
	<p>You are likely familiar with acoustic drum sets. These are what you would consider traditional drums, with wood shells (or often metal when it comes to snare drums) and metal cymbals.</p>
	<p>Electronic drums are pads with rubber, plastic, or mesh drumheads, and the sound is produced from a small box called a sound module. We then hear the sound through a headset or a speaker. It's important to note that unless you are buying a bundle deal, headsets and speakers are not included.</p>
	<p>We first saw mass-market consumer-level electronic drums in the late 1990s, with brands like Yamaha and Roland leading the way. Back then, the production and development costs were high, and the average price of an electric drum kit was beyond the reach of most beginner drummers.</p>
	<p>In the early 2000s, these two leading brands finally started to release models that came in at under $1000 US dollars for the first time. Since then, drumming as a hobby and the arrival of solid brands like Alesis have kept the market innovative and competitive, which is great news for beginner drummers.</p>

	<h2><p>Do electronic drums feel the same?</p></h2>
	<p>Something to consider with electronic drum sets is that unless you look at the top-end models, the drum pads are often undersized, with an average diameter of 8 inches. As these pads are mounted on a rack system provided with the set, the net result is that the drums are compacted together.</p>
	<p>While this may have some advantages with saving a small amount of space, the downside is that the playing position becomes cramped, affecting your posture and how you approach the drums. Some manufacturers like Pearl and Roland are now producing electronic drum sets that use full-sized drum shells, and this is a move in the right direction, but beware, these can be pricy options.</p>
	<p>One of the main differences is the overall difference in feel. Pads made from rubber, plastic, or mesh do not feel the same as hitting a real drum head. They are closer than ever before, but the pads that come with electronic sets can let you get away with certain things that acoustic drums will not.</p>
	<p>If work is needed on your technique, acoustic drums will reveal those opportunities, whereas mesh heads can let you cover up all sorts of drumming sins. You could use the analogy of running on a treadmill versus running on the road. The treadmill is great - itâ€™s comfortable, controllable, and smooth. The road is testing, which makes you work a little bit harder, but achieves better results.</p>
